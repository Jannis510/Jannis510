# Hi, I'm Jannis

M.Sc. candidate in Digital Medicine (Medical Data Science). I spend a lot of my time 
building things — mostly infrastructure and automation. Always looking to learn something new.

I'm into IT security, infrastructure, and AI development.

## Projects

### [Homelab Infrastructure](https://github.com/Jannis510/homelab-infrastructure)
Self-hosted, containerized setup with network isolation, a private PKI, and proper 
security architecture. Started as curiosity, turned into an ongoing project.

### Security Monitoring for FHIR Servers *(B.Sc. Thesis)*
Built a security monitoring system for a FHIR server using the Elastic Stack. 
No public repo due to confidentiality.
